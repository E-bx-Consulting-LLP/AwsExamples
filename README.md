# AWS Examples

This repo contains a collection of examples and useful information about developing .Net Core v6 solutions that will inform:

- Code, project and solution structure
- Templating tools, so the codebase develops a consitency across the solution
- AWS serverless stacks, so Lambda and FarGate (ECS)
- Deploying to AWS from Azure DevOps, so joining up an end-to-end provision, build, test, deploy (and test again) pipeline
